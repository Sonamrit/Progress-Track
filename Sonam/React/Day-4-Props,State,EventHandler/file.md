# ðŸ“˜What I Learned Today in React
Today, I explored some of the core concepts in React, including:

## ðŸ”¹ Props (Properties)
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

They are read-only, which means a child component cannot change the props it receives from the parent.

Props help make components reusable and dynamic.

## ðŸ”¹ State
State is a built-in object that allows components to manage and respond to changes over time.

Unlike props, state is mutable and managed within the component.

Updating state causes the component to re-render.

## ðŸ”¹ Handling Events
React handles events similarly to JavaScript but uses camelCase syntax and JSX functions.

You can define event handlers directly in the JSX or create functions and reference them.
